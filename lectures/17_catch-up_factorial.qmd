## Agenda

1.  Conditions for the Two-Way Factorial ANOVA
2.  Confidence intervals and effect sizes

## Example: Teaching Methods

A professor wanted to compare three different teaching methods to determine how students would perceive the course: 1) instructionist, 2) inquiry-based, and 3) team-based. She randomly assigned the same class (same topic different students) from 6 different semesters to treatments. At the end of the semester students were asked to rate the course on a 5-point scale, and the average class rating was calculated.

## Example: Swimsuit/Sweater Study

Objectification theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997) posits that American culture socializes women to adopt observers' perspectives on their physical selves. This self-objectification is hypothesized to (a) produce body shame, which in turn leads to restrained eating, and (b) consume attentional resources, which is manifested in diminished mental performance on a math test. An experiment manipulated self-objectification by having participants try on a swimsuit or a sweater. Further, it tested 20 women and 20 men, in each condition, and found that the effects on math performance were present for women only.

## Example: Anxiety and Memory

A psychologist wants to study the effect of anxiety on 4 different types of memory. Twelve participants are assigned to one of two anxiety conditions: 1) low anxiety group is told that they will be awarded \$5 for participation and \$10 if they remember sufficiently accurately, and 2) high anxiety group is told they will be awarded \$5 for participation and \$100 if they remember sufficiently accurately. All subjects perform four memory trials in random order, testing 4 different types of memory. The number of errors on each trial is recorded.

## Three Research Questions, Three F-ratios

1.  Is there a significant main effect of factor A?
2.  Is there a significant main effect of factor B?
3.  Is there an significant interaction between factor A and factor B?

## ANOVA Source Table for Two-Way Factorial

$${y}_{ijk}={\mu}+{\alpha}_{i}+{\beta}_{j}+{\alpha\beta}_{ij}+{e}_{ijk}$$

|         Source |                                             SS                                             |      df      |              MS               |              F               |
|--------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|    Treatment A |                     $\sum_{i=1}^{a}bn(\bar{y}_{i..}-\bar{y}_{…})^{2}$                      |    $a-1$     |  $\frac{{SS}_{A}}{{df}_{A}}$  | $\frac{{MS}_{A}}{{MS}_{E}}$  |
|    Treatment B |                     $\sum_{j=1}^{b}an(\bar{y}_{.j.}-\bar{y}_{…})^{2}$                      |    $b-1$     |  $\frac{{SS}_{B}}{{df}_{B}}$  | $\frac{{MS}_{B}}{{MS}_{E}}$  |
| Interaction AB | $n\sum_{i=1}^{a}\sum_{j=1}^{b}(\bar{y}_{ij.}-\bar{y}_{i..}-\bar{y}_{.j.}+\bar{y}_{…})^{2}$ | $(a-1)(b-1)$ | $\frac{{SS}_{AB}}{{df}_{AB}}$ | $\frac{{MS}_{AB}}{{MS}_{E}}$ |
|          Error |         $\sum_{i=1}^{a}\sum_{j=1}^{b}\sum_{k=1}^{n}({y}_{ijk}-\bar{y}_{ij.})^{2}$          |  $ab(n-1)$   |  $\frac{{SS}_{E}}{{df}_{E}}$  |                              |

## Confidence intervals and effect sizes

-   If the **interaction is significant**
    -   Calculate CIs and effect sizes for sets of *conditional averages* (also called "simple effects")
    -   For example, for the 0mg antibiotics condition, what's the effect size for B12
-   If the **interaction is NOT significant**
    -   Calculate CIs and effect sizes for sets of *marginal averages* (also called "main effects")
    -   For example, what is the effect size for B12 overall?

## Conditional Averages and Marginal Averages

-   The numbers in blue are *Marginal Averages*
-   The numbers in green are *Conditional Averages*

## Confidence Intervals and Effect Sizes

### Confidence Intervals

$$(\bar{y_i}-\bar{y_j}) \pm t^*\cdot SD \sqrt{1/n_i+1/n_j}$$

### Effect size

$$D_{ij} = \frac{(\bar{y_i}-\bar{y_j})}{SD}$$

-   Where $SD = \sqrt{MSE}$
