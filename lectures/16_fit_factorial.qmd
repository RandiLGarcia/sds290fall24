## Agenda

2.  MP2 Assignment and groups
3.  MP2 Work time

## MP2 Assignment

-   [MP2 Assignment Instructions](https://randilgarcia.github.io/sds290fall24/project/mini-project-2.html)
-   [MP2 Group Assignments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zbS0BiB_-DNn7Y13Ncsu0Yat6sBHM7LdG7YKpIx3GQ8/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

## MP2 Work time

-   [MP2 Group Assignments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zbS0BiB_-DNn7Y13Ncsu0Yat6sBHM7LdG7YKpIx3GQ8/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
-   Time to discuss your MP2 projects. 

### Goals for today:
-   Decide on a topic
-   Discuss your design and run it by me
-   Discuss your stimuli
-   Divide up your work (finding/creating stimuli, creating Qualtrics survey, writing consent form, preparing R code, ect.)

## Example: Teaching Methods

A professor wanted to compare three different teaching methods to determine how students would perceive the course: 1) instructionist, 2) inquiry-based, and 3) team-based. She randomly assigned the same class (same topic different students) from 6 different semesters to treatments. At the end of the semester students were asked to rate the course on a 5-point scale, and the average class rating was calculated.

## Example: Swimsuit/Sweater Study

Objectification theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997) posits that American culture socializes women to adopt observers' perspectives on their physical selves. This self-objectification is hypothesized to (a) produce body shame, which in turn leads to restrained eating, and (b) consume attentional resources, which is manifested in diminished mental performance on a math test. An experiment manipulated self-objectification by having participants try on a swimsuit or a sweater. Further, it tested 20 women and 20 men, in each condition, and found that the effects on math performance were present for women only.

## Example: Anxiety and Memory

A psychologist wants to study the effect of anxiety on 4 different types of memory. Twelve participants are assigned to one of two anxiety conditions: 1) low anxiety group is told that they will be awarded \$5 for participation and \$10 if they remember sufficiently accurately, and 2) high anxiety group is told they will be awarded \$5 for participation and \$100 if they remember sufficiently accurately. All subjects perform four memory trials in random order, testing 4 different types of memory. The number of errors on each trial is recorded.


<!-- ## ANOVA Source Table for Two-Way Factorial -->

<!-- $${y}_{ijk}={\mu}+{\alpha}_{i}+{\beta}_{j}+{\alpha\beta}_{ij}+{e}_{ijk}$$ -->

<!-- |         Source |                                             SS                                             |      df      |              MS               |              F               | -->
<!-- |--------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:| -->
<!-- |    Treatment A |                     $\sum_{i=1}^{a}bn(\bar{y}_{i..}-\bar{y}_{…})^{2}$                      |    $a-1$     |  $\frac{{SS}_{A}}{{df}_{A}}$  | $\frac{{MS}_{A}}{{MS}_{E}}$  | -->
<!-- |    Treatment B |                     $\sum_{j=1}^{b}an(\bar{y}_{.j.}-\bar{y}_{…})^{2}$                      |    $b-1$     |  $\frac{{SS}_{B}}{{df}_{B}}$  | $\frac{{MS}_{B}}{{MS}_{E}}$  | -->

<!-- |          Error |         $\sum_{i=1}^{a}\sum_{j=1}^{b}\sum_{k=1}^{n}({y}_{ijk}-\bar{y}_{ij.})^{2}$          |  $ab(n-1)$   |  $\frac{{SS}_{E}}{{df}_{E}}$  |                              | -->

<!-- ## Conditional Averages and Marginal Averages -->

<!-- ![](pics/marginalmeans.png) -->

<!-- -   The numbers in blue are *Marginal Averages* -->
<!-- -   The numbers in green are *Conditional Averages* -->

<!-- ## Confidence intervals and effect sizes -->

<!-- -   If the **interaction is significant** -->
<!--     -   Calculate CIs and effect sizes for differences in *conditional averages* (also called "simple effects") -->
<!--     -   For example, for the 0mg antibiotics condition, what's the effect size for B12 -->
<!-- -   If the **interaction is NOT significant** -->
<!--     -   Calculate CIs and effect sizes for sets of *marginal averages* (also called "main effects") -->
<!--     -   For example, what is the effect size for B12 overall? -->

<!-- ## Confidence Intervals and Effect Sizes -->

<!-- ### Confidence Intervals -->

<!-- $$(\bar{y_i}-\bar{y_j}) \pm t^*\cdot SD \sqrt{1/n_i+1/n_j}$$ -->

<!-- ### Effect size -->

<!-- $$D_{ij} = \frac{(\bar{y_i}-\bar{y_j})}{SD}$$ -->

<!-- -   Where $SD = \sqrt{MSE}$ -->

<!-- ## Two-Way Factorial in R -->

<!-- [See Two-Way Factorial code](https://randilgarcia.github.io/sds290fall24/code/09_two-way_fac_inR.Rmd) -->
